This folder is dedicated to the course [`Optimization Methods`](https://fixelalgorithms.gitlab.io/courses/optimizationmethods) which took place on December 2023.  
The course was conducted in MATLAB.

### Final Project

Solve the problem:

$$ \arg \min_{\boldsymbol{x}} \frac{1}{2} {\left\| \boldsymbol{x} - \boldsymbol{y} \right\|}_{2}^{2} \quad \text{subject to} \quad {\left\| \boldsymbol{D} \boldsymbol{x} \right\|}_{1} \leq \lambda $$

Where $\boldsymbol{D}$ is the _forward_ finite differences operator.
