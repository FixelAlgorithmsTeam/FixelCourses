    "Intuition about the minimization and the loss landscape:\n",
    "\n",
    " * Good / Proper Local Minimum  \n",
    "   Though not rigorously proved, the common concept is that a wide and deep local minimum as almost as good as the global minimum.  \n",
    "   The intuition is based on the idea that given millions of directions to move, the probability there is no improvement in any direction is a unique case.  \n",
    "   Though it is not a single phenomenon, it is probably similar in its results.\n",
    " * The SGD as a Regularizer  \n",
    "   Since the SGD uses a noisy estimation of the _gradient_ it may \"escape\" a bad local minima (Narrow, not deep).  \n",
    "   Those \"sensitive\" local minima can be thought as \"over fitting\" as usually they don't generalize well.  \n",
    "   Yet escaping wide deep local minima is less likely.\n",
    " * Batch Size  \n",
    "   The bigger the batch, the better the approximation.  \n",
    "   Yet, in practice the most limiting factor is the memory of the GPU and the speed of computation.  \n",
    "   So it selected to maximize the number of iterations within the envelope of the memory and speed.\n",
    " * Iterations  \n",
    "   Each batch creates a \"Forward\" and \"Backward\" step.  \n",
    "   To even out the estimation over the samples the batch in each iteration can be drawn randomly.\n",
    " * Optimization Methods  \n",
    "   Since the SGD uses approximated / estimated gradient most acceleration methods can be viewed as variance reduction methods of the estimation.\n",
    " * Speed of Convergence  \n",
    "   The SGD is also superior as it allows within the same time budget making much more iterations.  \n",
    "   Compare single accurate iteration vs. 1000 approximated iterations. In practice the latter is much faster to converge.\n",
