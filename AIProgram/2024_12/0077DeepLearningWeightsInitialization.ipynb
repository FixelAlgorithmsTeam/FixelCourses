    "   Vanishing gradients reduces the ability of the net to learn.  \n",

    "\n",
    "The concept of proper initialization tries to maximize the probability of the net starting point to be closer to a proper local minima.  \n",
    "The idea is to set the weights in a manner which keeps the variance of the data moving in the net proper in the first forward step.\n",
